I like developing geospatial imagery pipelines, teaching data science [workshops](https://github.com/ua-datalab/Geospatial_Workshops/wiki), and deploying cloud infrastructure with [Cyverse](http://www.cyverse.org).

I'm on a mission to make the world's drone imagery accessible and useful for land and resource management.
